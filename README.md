# Assignment_ToDoList
It is a list of things we need to get do.
Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory aid.
As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets, word and Todo list Apps.
When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. 
This gives you a sense of progress and achievement, something you’ll lack if you’re always rushing from one task to the next.
